## Example Use Cases

1. **AI Model Development**
```python
# @knowledge(entity="model:transformer", relation="implements"): Neural transformer model
Type TransformerConfig:
    hidden_size: Int
    num_layers: Int
    num_heads: Int
    ff_dim: Int

# Brain reasoning about model architecture
Brain Architecture:
    Given hidden_size h and num_heads n,
    each attention head should have dimension h/n
    to maintain computational efficiency.

# Hat implementing the model based on Brain's reasoning
Process called "create_transformer" that takes config:
    # @knowledge(entity="operation:attention", relation="uses"): Multi-head attention
    Let attention_head_size be config.hidden_size / config.num_heads
    
    # Create attention heads
    Let attention_heads be list containing
    For i from 0 to config.num_heads:
        Let head be create_attention_head with dim as attention_head_size
        Add head to attention_heads
    
    # Create feed-forward network
    Let ffn be create_ffn with dim as config.ff_dim
    
    Return Transformer with heads as attention_heads and ffn as ffn
```

2. **Knowledge-Enhanced Code Analysis**
```python
# Connect to knowledge graph
Knowledge Query from "ml_ontology":
    SELECT ?algorithm ?complexity
    WHERE {
        ?algorithm a :SortingAlgorithm ;
                   :hasComplexity ?complexity .
    }

# Use knowledge in code implementation
Process called "optimal_sort" that takes array and size_threshold:
    # @knowledge(entity="algorithm:sorting", relation="selects"): Choose optimal algorithm
    If length of array <= size_threshold:
        # @knowledge(entity="algorithm:insertion_sort", relation="uses"): 
        # Insertion sort is faster for small arrays
        Return insertion_sort with arr as array
    Otherwise:
        # @knowledge(entity="algorithm:quick_sort", relation="uses"): 
        # QuickSort is faster for larger arrays
        Return quick_sort with arr as array
```
