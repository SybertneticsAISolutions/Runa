## Runa Overview

Runa is a revolutionary programming language designed to bridge human thought patterns with machine execution. Named after Norse runes that encoded knowledge and meaning, Runa features pseudocode-like syntax that resembles natural language while maintaining the precision needed for computational execution.

### Project Status

Runa is currently in active development. The language implementation includes both core features and advanced programming paradigms.

### Features

#### Core Features
- Natural language-like syntax
- Python-like indentation for block structure
- Transpilation to Python (with more target languages planned)
- Function definitions with named parameters
- Variables and assignments
- Control structures (if-else, for-each)
- Lists and dictionaries
- Basic type system with inference

#### Advanced Features
- **Pattern Matching**: Sophisticated pattern matching with destructuring for data extraction and case analysis
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Native async/await syntax for non-blocking operations
- **Functional Programming**: First-class functions, pipelines, and higher-order operations
- **Enhanced Type System**: Rich type annotations, inference, and checking
- **AI-to-AI Communication**: Specialized annotations for communication between AI components

#### Runtime Features
- **Native Virtual Machine**: RunaVM for consistent cross-platform execution
- **JIT Compilation**: Just-in-time compilation for optimized performance
- **Bytecode Format**: Compact bytecode representation of Runa programs
- **Embedding API**: Integrate Runa into applications as a scripting language
- **Foreign Function Interface**: Call native libraries from Runa
- **Sandbox Security**: Configurable security controls for untrusted code

## Basic Example

```
# hello_world.runa
Let message be "Hello, world!"
Display message

Process called "greet" that takes name:
    Let greeting be "Hello, " followed by name
    Display greeting

greet with name as "Runa"
```

## Running Runa Code

```bash
# Compile Runa to Python
runa compile hello_world.runa

# Run Runa code directly
runa run hello_world.runa

# Start the REPL
runa repl

# Enable advanced language features
runa compile --advanced hello_world.runa
runa run --advanced hello_world.runa
runa repl --advanced

# Run with the RunaVM
runavm hello_world.runa

# Compile to bytecode
runa compile --bytecode hello_world.runa
```

## Embedding Runa

Runa can be embedded in your applications as a scripting language:

```c
#include <runavm.h>

int main() {
    // Create VM
    RunaVM* vm = runa_vm_create();
    
    // Load script
    runa_vm_load_file(vm, "script.runa");
    
    // Call Runa function
    RunaValue result;
    runa_vm_call_function(vm, "calculate", NULL, 0, &result);
    
    // Use result
    printf("Result: %lld\n", runa_value_as_integer(result));
    runa_value_release(&result);
    
    // Clean up
    runa_vm_destroy(vm);
    return 0;
}
```
