# Knowledge Graph Integration Examples
# This file showcases how Runa integrates with knowledge graphs

# Import knowledge graph modules
import runa.ai.knowledge_graph
import runa.ai.semantic_linking

# Example 1: Creating and querying a simple knowledge graph
Process called "create_knowledge_graph":
    # Create a new knowledge graph
    Let graph = KnowledgeGraph.create("example_graph")
    
    # Add entities
    graph.add_entity("Person", "Alice", {"age": 30, "profession": "Engineer"})
    graph.add_entity("Person", "Bob", {"age": 28, "profession": "Designer"})
    graph.add_entity("Company", "TechCorp", {"founded": 2010, "location": "San Francisco"})
    
    # Add relationships
    graph.add_relationship("Alice", "WORKS_FOR", "TechCorp")
    graph.add_relationship("Bob", "WORKS_FOR", "TechCorp")
    graph.add_relationship("Alice", "KNOWS", "Bob")
    
    # Query the graph
    Let employees = graph.query("MATCH (p:Person)-[:WORKS_FOR]->(c:Company) WHERE c.name = 'TechCorp' RETURN p")
    
    For employee in employees:
        Print(employee.name + " works at TechCorp as a " + employee.profession)
    
    Return graph

# Example 2: Semantic linking with code entities
Process called "semantic_linking_example" that takes codebase_path:
    # Create a semantic linker for the codebase
    Let linker = SemanticLinker.create(codebase_path)
    
    # Analyze the codebase and build semantic links
    linker.analyze()
    
    # Find semantically related functions
    Let related_functions = linker.find_related("calculate_average", threshold=0.7)
    
    Print("Functions related to calculate_average:")
    For func in related_functions:
        Print("- " + func.name + " (similarity: " + func.similarity + ")")
    
    # Generate documentation based on semantic understanding
    Let documentation = linker.generate_documentation("calculate_average")
    Print(documentation)
    
    Return related_functions

# Example 3: Knowledge visualization
Process called "visualize_knowledge":
    # Create a graph visualization
    Let visualizer = KnowledgeVisualizer.create()
    
    # Load a knowledge graph
    Let graph = KnowledgeGraph.load("example_graph")
    
    # Configure visualization options
    visualizer.set_options({
        "node_color": "type",
        "edge_width": "weight",
        "layout": "force_directed"
    })
    
    # Generate the visualization
    visualizer.render(graph, "knowledge_graph_visualization.html")
    
    Return "Visualization created successfully"

# Example 4: Reasoning with knowledge graphs
Process called "knowledge_reasoning" that takes question:String:
    # Create a reasoning engine
    Let reasoner = KnowledgeReasoner.create()
    
    # Load knowledge from different sources
    reasoner.load_graph("domain_knowledge")
    reasoner.load_ontology("domain_ontology.owl")
    
    # Run inference to derive new knowledge
    reasoner.infer_relationships()
    
    # Answer questions based on the knowledge graph
    Let answer = reasoner.answer_question(question)
    
    Return answer

# Example 5: Advanced semantic analysis
Process called "analyze_code_semantics" that takes code_file:
    # Analyze the semantics of code
    Let analyzer = SemanticAnalyzer.create()
    
    # Parse the code file
    Let parsed_code = analyzer.parse(code_file)
    
    # Extract concepts and relationships
    Let concepts = analyzer.extract_concepts(parsed_code)
    Let relationships = analyzer.extract_relationships(parsed_code)
    
    # Build a conceptual model
    Let model = analyzer.build_model(concepts, relationships)
    
    # Generate insights
    Let insights = analyzer.generate_insights(model)
    
    Return {
        "concepts": concepts,
        "relationships": relationships,
        "insights": insights
    }
